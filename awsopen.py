# This script will add your current IP address to your security group in AWS VPC (port 22, ssh)
# In VPCs you can't use the security group name as reference, you must use the security group id
# like: "sg-01234567". Also, this script uses the ~/.aws/credentials file for AWS credentials.
#
# Setup:
#   You need "boto" and "urllib2" packages in Python to run this. "pip install boto" will probably do.
#
#   secgroup = "" set the security group ID
#   aws_profile = "" set the aws profile name you want to use (from your ~/.aws/credentials)
#   aws_region = "eu-west-1" set the AWS region you want to use
